<h1>Call for Paper</h1>

<div class="text-justify conference-text">

<p>EuroMPI/USA 2025 will continue to focus on advancing the ubiquitous Message Passing Interface (MPI) model and specification of parallel programming. It will also encompass extensions and alternative interfaces for high-performance heterogeneous and hybrid systems, benchmarks, tools, parallel I/O, fault tolerance, and parallel applications using MPI and other interfaces.</p>  

<p>EuroMPI/USA 2025 will be hosted by the University of North Carolina, Charlotte and will be co-located with <a href="https://www.iwomp.org/">IWOMP 2025</a> (October 1 - October 3, 2025), with joint tutorials, and opportunities for interaction between the two communities.</p>

<p>Through the presentation of full papers, position papers, posters, and invited talks, the meeting will provide ample opportunities for attendees to interact and share ideas and experiences to contribute to the improvement and furthering of message-passing and related parallel programming paradigms.</p>

<p>Having EuroMPI, IWOMP and the MPI Forum grouped together provides enables attendees to interact and share ideas and experiences to contribute to the improvement and furthering of message-passing, shared-memory parallelism, and related parallel programming paradigms -- and their combined usage.</p>



<p>We invite high-quality, full and short paper submissions on all topics related to message-passing parallel programming with MPI and related or competing models. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Implementation Issues and Algorithms</b>: Efficient and scalable implementations of message-passing constructs.</li>
<li> <b>Architectures and systems</b>: Towards exascale computing, efficient use of accelerators and other features of modern, large-scale systems, hardware-software interaction.</li>
<li> <b>Message Passing for accelerator-based compute architectures</b>, including multi-GPU, TPU, and AI-accelerator systems.
<li> <b>Programming models and paradigms</b> related to MPI targeting large-scale, parallel, distributed memory systems, hierarchical and hybrid models, partitioned global address space (PGAS) models.</li>
<li> <b>Extensions to and shortcomings of MPI</b>: alternative interfaces and solutions.</li>
<li> <b>New, parallel (MPI-)I/O mechanisms optimizations</b>.</li>
<li> <b>Hybrid and heterogeneous programming</b> with MPI and other interfaces.</li>
<li> Message passing interface support for <b>data-intensive parallel applications</b>.</li>
<li> <b>Fault tolerance</b> in message-passing implementations and systems.</li>
<li> MPI parallel programming in <b>clouds and non-dedicated systems</b>.</li>
<li> <b>Performance evaluation</b> for MPI and MPI-based applications.</li>
<li> <b>Automatic performance tuning</b> of applications and implementations.</li>
<li> <b>Verification</b> of message-passing applications and protocols.</li>
<li> <b>Applications</b> using advanced message passing, in particular in computational science and scientific computing.</li>
<li> <b>Parallel algorithms</b> in the message-passing paradigm.</li>
<li> <b>Interactions</b> between the message-passing library and runtime systems.</li>
<li> Use of MPI in <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM)</b> and its challenges</li>
<li> Integration and comparisons with competing industry standards (e.g., NCCL, RCCL)</li>
</ul>


<p>Papers will be reviewed for quality, originality, clarity, correctness, technical strength, and relevance to the topics of the meeting. Each paper will receive at least three reviews from members of the program committee. Reviews are <b>single-anonymous</b> (but not double-anonymous); the names of the authors will be seen by the program committee.</p>

<p>Among the papers selected for presentation, a few of the best papers will, as has been the tradition in past years, be selected by the program committee and recommended for publication in a EuroMPI/USA 2025 Special Issue of a Journal. More details about the journal special issue will be provided soon. These papers will go through a separate round of reviews, and are intended as extended, more polished archival versions of the conference versions.</p>

<p>Papers that are not accepted for presentation as full papers may be recommended for poster presentations. High-quality short papers will be included in the proceedings. Posters will be published informally on the website, but are not intended to appear in the regular conference proceedings. Even without official proceedings, we consider posters as a good opportunity to present early work to the community, which can lead to discussions, constructive feedbacks, and collaboration opportunities.</p>
